## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

**Before Committing**:
```bash
# 1. No hardcoded secrets
❌ val apiKey = "sk_live_abc123"
✅ val apiKey = BuildConfig.API_KEY

# 2. No sensitive data in logs
❌ Log.d(TAG, "User password: $password")
✅ Log.d(TAG, "User authenticated")

# 3. Validate all inputs
❌ database.rawQuery("SELECT * WHERE id=$id")
✅ database.rawQuery("SELECT * WHERE id=?", arrayOf(id))
```

**During Review**:
- Check for security issues
- Verify input validation
- Review permission usage
- Check network security
- Validate data storage
